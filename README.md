# Machine Learning Lab 5: Face Detection and Clustering

Aim :The aim of this lab is to perform face detection, extract features, apply clustering, and compare similarity using distance metrics.

Methodology
1. Loaded input image using OpenCV
2. Detected faces using Haar Cascade classifier
3. Converted image to HSV color space
4. Extracted Hue and Saturation features
5. Applied K-Means clustering (k=2)
6. Visualized clusters using scatter plot
7. Compared faces using Euclidean distance

Key Findings
- Faces were successfully detected from the image
- K-Means grouped faces based on color features
- Euclidean distance helped identify the closest matching face
- Visualization showed clear clustering patterns

Results
- Scatter plot showing clusters
- Template face matched with closest face in dataset

Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how distance metrics and clustering can be used in face similarity analysis. The approach can be extended to real-world applications like face recognition systems.
